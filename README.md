# Joke API Test Automation Framework

This project is an automated test framework for the **Official Joke API**. It is developed in **Java 17** using **Maven**, **Cucumber**, and **RestAssured**, and it allows testing main endpoints as well as negative scenarios of the API.

---

## 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Before running the tests, you need to install and configure the following:

### 1. Java 17

- **Why Java 17?**  
  Java 17 is a stable LTS version, fully compatible with RestAssured 5.5.5 and Cucumber 7.22.2, and widely supported in modern CI/CD pipelines.

- **Download and install:**  
  [Adoptium (OpenJDK 17)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)  
  Follow the instructions for your operating system.

  - **Verify installation:**

        java -version

    It should return something like 17.x.x

### 2. Maven

- **Why Maven?**  
  Maven is used to manage dependencies, plugins, build the project, and run tests.

- **Download and install:**

  [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
  - **Verify installation:**
  
        mvn -version

    It should show Maven 3.x.x and Java 17 as the JDK.

### 3. IDE (optional but recommended)

- **[IntelIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows)**
- **IDE setup:**
  
    Open the project as a Maven project

    Configure Project SDK to Java 17

    Ensure Project language level is 17


##  2️⃣ Clone the project and initial setup

1. **Clone the repository:**


        git clone https://github.com/JoseManuelGraoSoto/assesmentSantanderBankPolska.git

2. **Open the project in IntelliJ:**

    File → Open → select project folder

    IntelliJ will detect it as a Maven project automatically.

3. **Configure the JDK in IntelliJ:**

    File → Project Structure → Project → Project SDK → select Java 17

    Ensure Project language level is also set to 17.

4. **Refresh Maven:**

    IntelliJ → Maven → Reload Project

    This downloads all dependencies defined in pom.xml.

##  3️⃣ About the pom.xml

- **The pom.xml file is used to:**

    Declare dependencies such as Cucumber, RestAssured, and JUnit

    Configure the build and plugins (for example, Maven Surefire to run tests)

    Manage versions and library compatibility


- **Main Dependencies**

| Library        | Version  | Main Use                                           |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Cucumber Java  | 7.22.2  | Writing features and step definitions           |
| Cucumber JUnit | 7.22.2  | Running Cucumber tests with JUnit 4             |
| JUnit          | 4.13.2  | Testing framework for assertions and runners    |
| RestAssured    | 5.5.5   | Making HTTP requests and validating responses  |
| Json-Path      | 5.5.5   | Parsing JSON and validating response content   |

All versions were obtained from [mvnrepo](mvnrepository.com) and were chosen to ensure compatibility and stability with Java 17.

## 4️⃣ Project Structure

- `/src/main/java`  
   API client (e.g., `JokeApiClient`, `ApiConfig`)

- `/src/test/java`  
  Step Definitions, Test Runners

- `/src/test/resources/features`  
  Cucumber `.feature` files

- `pom.xml`  
  Project configuration and dependencies

- `README.md`  
  Documentation

- `DEVLOG.md`  
  Development log

> ⚠️ All RestAssured and Cucumber code is in `/src/test/java` because these are tests, not production code.


## 5️⃣ How to Execute Tests

### Option 1 - Using Maven from Terminal

    mvn clean test 

Runs all tests in src/test/java

Displays results in the console, including the status of each scenario (passed/failed)

### Option 2 – Using the Cucumber Runner in IntelliJ

Open the class runners.RunnerTest

Right-click → Run 'RunnerTest'

IntelliJ will execute the tests and show results in the Run window

A visual report will be generated in target/cucumber-report.html which can be opened in any browser
