**Date:** 2026-02-08  19:57

**Description:**
- Added basic project structure: `/src/main/java`, `/src/test/java`, `/src/test/resources/features`
- Created `pom.xml` with initial dependencies: Cucumber, RestAssured, JUnit
- Wrote README with installation instructions, project setup, and explanation of dependencies  
  **Reasoning:**
- Setup project skeleton to have a clear folder structure for framework code and tests
- Documented the environment setup so that anyone cloning the repo can run the project immediately
